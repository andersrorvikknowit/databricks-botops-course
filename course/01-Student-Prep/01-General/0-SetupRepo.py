# MAGIC     - It should have a unique branch name which does NOT contain your name. It could be named like such: `feat/gh-[ your initial letters converted to number ]-[ favourite place ]`, but not too long, using the character number [from here](https://www.worldometers.info/languages/how-many-letters-alphabet/).
# MAGIC     - E.g.: `feat-gh[pv]-[place]` => `feat-gh1622-assisi`.
# MAGIC     - Again, do NOT use your name or username as part of the branch name.  Don't use non-ascii characters in the place name.
