# MAGIC We will do our tasks in the context of the folder representing the tripbot data pipeline or flow:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC `orgs/acme/domains/transport/projects/taxinyc/flows/ml/tripbot/`
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The structure is: 
# MAGIC - org: `acme`
# MAGIC     - domain: `transport`
# MAGIC         - project: `taxinyc`
# MAGIC             - flowtype: `prep` (meaning ETL/data engineering, the alternative is `ml`, for ML work)
# MAGIC                 - flow: `tripbot` 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The structure will be applied to:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Model / Bot / Agent naming
# MAGIC - Data *code*, i.e. the pyspark code herein git
# MAGIC - The database *tables* produced by that code
# MAGIC - The data pipelines being deployed
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The purpose of this structure is to have sufficient granularity to enable each department/org, team/domain, project and pipeline, to be kept apart.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC You can explore the structure here in Databricks, or more easily [in the repo with a browser](https://github.com/paalvibe/databricks-botops-course).
